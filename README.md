READ ME: skeleton tracking.

The python scripts presented all require the OpenCV module to run, some files may also require you to access the Haarcascade folder from OpenCV.  You should be able to get these locations by typing haarcascade into your computers file searcher. The facial classifier line will then need to have the path manually changed.
All figures produced can be found in the folder labelled ‘report figures’ and all images and videos needed to run the code are in the folder labelled ‘visual data’. If the code doesn’t run it is most likely due to a file path error in either the video/image folder or with OpenCV being called correctly.
All code should be fully commented so that it is clear which part does what.
